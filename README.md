| Load 8-bit data from the memory | [link](WEEK-1/2.asm) |
| Load the contents of memory location `9000H` directly to the `Accumulator`. Then transfer the result to `Register B`. The content of memory location `9000H` is `FFH` | [link](WEEK-1/3.asm) |
| Load the contents of memory location `9050H` in `Register B`. Then transfer the result to `Accumulator`. Increment the contnt of the `Accumulator` and store the result in `9051H` | [link](WEEK-1/4.asm) |
| Store the datatype `FFH` in the memory location `9000H` | [link](WEEK-1/5.asm) |
| Store 8-bit data in a memory location | [link](WEEK-1/6.asm) |
| Transfer 10-bytes of data from one data block to another | [link](WEEK-1/7.asm) |

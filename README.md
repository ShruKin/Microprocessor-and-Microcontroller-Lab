# WEEK-1
| Question | Code |
|----------|------|
| Load 8-bit data from the memory | [link](WEEK-1/2.asm) |
| Load the contents of memory location `9000H` directly to the `Accumulator`. Then transfer the result to `Register B`. The content of memory location `9000H` is `FFH` | [link](WEEK-1/3.asm) |
| Load the contents of memory location `9050H` in `Register B`. Then transfer the result to `Accumulator`. Increment the contnt of the `Accumulator` and store the result in `9051H` | [link](WEEK-1/4.asm) |
| Store the datatype `FFH` in the memory location `9000H` | [link](WEEK-1/5.asm) |
| Store 8-bit data in a memory location | [link](WEEK-1/6.asm) |
| Transfer 10-bytes of data from one data block to another | [link](WEEK-1/7.asm) |
| Exchange the contents of memory location `9050H` and `9051H` | [link](WEEK-1/8.asm) |
| Add two 8-bit numbers | [link](WEEK-1/9.asm) |
| Add two 16-bit numbers | [link](WEEK-1/10.asm) |

# WEEK-2
| Question | Code |
|----------|------|
| Add the numbers in memory locations `9000H` and `9001H`. Store the result in `9002H` | [link](WEEK-2/1.asm) |
| Two 16-bit numbers are available in memory locations (`9000H` and `9001H`) and (`9002H` and `9003H`), where the most significant bits are in `9001H` and `9003H`. Add two numbers and save the result in `9004H` and `9005H`, with the most significant byte in `9005H` | [link](WEEK-2/2.asm) |
| Two numbers are stored in memory locations `9000H` and `9001H`. Add them and store the result (including carry) in memory locations `9002H` and `9003H` | [link](WEEK-2/3.asm) |
| Subtract the content of memory location `9001H` from that of memory location `9000H` and store the result in memory location `9002H` | [link](WEEK-2/4.asm) |
| Subtract two 16-bit numbers | [link](WEEK-2/5.asm) |
| Multiply two 8-bit binary numbers | [link](WEEK-2/6.asm) |
| Multiply two 16-bit binary numbers | [link](WEEK-2/7.asm) |
| Find One's complement of a number | [link](WEEK-2/8.asm) |
| Find Two's complement of a number | [link](WEEK-2/9.asm) |
| Find Two's complement of a 16-bit number | [link](WEEK-2/10.asm) |
| Find Two's complement of the number stored in memory location `9000H` and store the result in memory location `9001H` | [link](WEEK-2/11.asm) |

# WEEK-3
| Question | Code |
|----------|------|
| Read and complement the contents of the flag register | [link](WEEK-1/1.asm) |
| `9050H` be a memory location where `FFH` data is stored. Now,find One's complement of the data and transfer the result in `9051H` memory location | [link](WEEK-1/2.asm) |
| `9060H` and `9061H` be two consecutive memory locations where `0054H` data is stored. Now, find One's complement of the data and transfer the result in `9071H` and `9072H` memory locations | [link](WEEK-1/3.asm) |
| `9050H` be a memory location where `FFH` data is stored. Now, find Two's complement of the data and transfer the result in `9051H` memory location | [link](WEEK-1/5.asm) |
| `9060H` and `9061H` be two consecutive memory locations where `0054H` data is stored. Now, find Two's complement of the data and transfer the result in `9071H` and `9072H` memory locations | [link](WEEK-1/6.asm) |
| `9060H` and `9061H` be two consecutive memory locations where `54H` and `09H` data is stored. Now, do a OR operation between them and transfer the result in `9071H` memory location | [link](WEEK-1/7.asm) |
| `9060H` and `9061H` be two consecutive memory locations where `0AH` and `07H` data is stored. Now, do a XOR operation between them and transfer the result in `9071H` memory location | [link](WEEK-1/8.asm) |
| Let us assume, `9060H` and `9061H` be two consecutive memory locations where `FDH` and `05H` data is stored. Now, do a AND operation between them and transfer the result in `9071H` memory location | [link](WEEK-1/9.asm) |
